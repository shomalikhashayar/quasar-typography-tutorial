# quasar-typography-tutorial
In this tutorial we will learn how to use typography in Quasar Framework.

## Why Quasar?
> Because it saves development costs drastically.

### Also because:

* It’s based on Vue.js
* You get a state-of-the-art UI (that follows Material Guidelines) for your websites and apps out of the box
* Best support for desktop and mobile browsers (including iOS Safari!) out of the box
* Best-in-class support for each build mode (SPA, SSR, PWA, Mobile app, Desktop app & Browser Extension) and the best developer experience through a tight integration with our own CLI
* It’s easily customizable (CSS) and extendable (JS)
* It’s the most performance-focused framework
* It’s tree-shakable automatically
* Incredible community on our Forum and Discord chat
* Has a regular release cycle inclusive of new features
* Gets quick fixes and listens to the community’s requests
* Handles the whole development experience (including even creating your app’s icons and splash screens)

Worried about bloat? You shouldn’t be.
If you only want to build a website, Quasar will only build the code required for a website, with nothing else. Same goes for the other build modes.
